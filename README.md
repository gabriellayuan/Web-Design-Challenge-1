# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

 A Dashboard website to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. Specifically, we will be plotting weather data.
 
 In this dashboard, each plot has an individual page and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
 
 The live deployed website can be found here: Web Visualization Dashboard https://hrao-dev.github.io/WebVisualizations/index.html
